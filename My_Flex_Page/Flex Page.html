            One of my current passions is coding, as this is my favorite things to do<br>
            I started coding since grade 11 but has lost passion after it. But I gain this<br>
            Passion again ever since I enrolled here. I gain this passion because of video games<br>
            and I also wanted to create my own game too, that's why I gain passion in coding.<br>
            But Coding is not the only things I like, I also like drawings too! some of it are sketches!
            I mostly draw digitally since it is easier than traditional, but I also like traditional too.<br>

        as well as FNF (Friday Night Funkin), I have many more of my drawings, even though they are not yet perfect or not yet finished, I still like
        my drawings! I will find more way to improve my traditional drawing skill.

        because it is way less hassle than traditional, some of my drawings are from video games as well, but I also create my own character too using my
        imagination, I also have many thing that I draw such as FNAF (Five Nights At Freddy's) and many more! I try and improve too in digital arts.

        the most recent codes that I learn was C and Python! I also have fun in doing some HTML and made a little website and have fun in creating one.
        Even though coding can be very difficult to me, I'll try more, learn and experiment some more to be a good programmer in the future.
